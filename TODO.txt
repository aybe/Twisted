- decode polygons
 - implement frame buffer
 - implement texturing

- on restored tree view selection, the scene is not updated
- a way to check for valid normals
 - read whole file
 - check that indices don't cross node

 - adjust polygon position in preview

 - there is an alpha mask for 16-bit TIMs

 when loading a DMD, associated TMS should be loaded

when generating a model, TMS should be passed

generate the texture for the model with N polygons:
	for each textured polygon, generate a texture
			texture page, format, palette, etc
	pack these textures into an atlas
		there will be duplicates so use a hash set

// BUG binary writer extensions: WriteEnum, overloads for byte with endianness

move stuff to psx lib
move stuff to unity lib
move stuff to binary extensions
	add package to unity
		see if twisted can have a dependency
do texturing
